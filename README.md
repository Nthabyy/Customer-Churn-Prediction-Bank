Explainability Tools
This project incorporates LIME and SHAP for model explainability:

LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations): Provides local explanations for individual predictions.
SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations): Provides both global and local feature importance and visualizations such as:

Summary Plots
Force Plots
Dependence Plots
Feature Importance: Identifies the most influential features using the Random Forest algorithmâ€™s built-in feature importance.
